Scoring
- Items 1, 2, 4: 0-3 (top = 0, bottom = 3).
- Items 3, 5-10: Reverse-scored (top = 3, bottom = 0).
- Total Score: 0-30.
- Interpretation:
  - 0-9: Scores in this range may indicate the presence of some symptoms of distress that may be shortlived and are less likely to interfere with day to day ability to function at home or at work. However if these symptoms have persisted more than a week or two further enquiry is warranted.
  - 10-12: Scores within this range indicate presence of symptoms of distress that may be discomforting. Repeat the EDS in 2 weeks time and continue monitoring progress regularly. If the scores increase to above 12 assess further and consider referral as needed.
  - 13+: Scores above 12 require further assessment and appropriate management as the likelihood of depression is high. Referral to a psychiatrist/psychologist may be necessary.
  - Item 10: Any woman who scores 1, 2 or 3 on item 10 requires further evaluation before leaving the office to ensure her own safety and that of her baby.

Clinical Notes
- Action: If Item 10 score ≥1, alert clinician for self-harm inquiry.
- Follow-Up: Repeat EPDS every 2-4 weeks if score 10-12.
- Use: Combine with clinical interviews for PPD assessment.

Ethical Notes
- Non-Diagnostic: Screening tool only, not a substitute for professional diagnosis.
- Safety: Immediate follow-up for Item 10 positive responses.
